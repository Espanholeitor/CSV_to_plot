The py Script reads data form the CSV files and then create some plots

The data are somo logs recorded with romraider in my car

The logs contains several data fields but the most important are Load and RPM

I did some changes in the DISA tables of the DME in my car and record some logs in each case

The DISA is a valve that changes the geometry of the intake manifold and it is present in some BMW models such as e46

By doign this I can compare and see which did better under different RPM Ranges

This is done as a learning experience and I do not encurage you to modify any paramters of your car, this should be performed just by profesionals
